# More money, more effect? Employment effects of job search services of different intensity

This is the repository for the scripts used in the working paper “More
money, more effect? Employment effects of job search services of
different intensity” (Junquera, 2025). The main scripts are in the
`source` folder. The working paper is available at
<https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rjshu_v2>.

To ensure reproducibility, we use the `renv` package. Just place all the
files of this repository in your R working directory and run the
following chunk of code. It will install the versions of the packages
that we used to obtain our results.

``` r
# Install {renv} if not yet installed
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```
